The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed invocations. Provide an options object to indicate that `func`\n * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout.\n * Subsequent calls to the debounced function return the result of the last\n * `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false] Specify invoking on the leading\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait] The maximum time `func` is allowed to be\n *  delayed before it is invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true] Specify invoking on the trailing\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // invoke `sendMail` when the click event is fired, debouncing subsequent calls\n * jQuery('#postbox').on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', _.debounce(batchLog, 250, {\n *   'maxWait': 1000\n * }));\n *\n * // cancel a debounced call\n * var todoChanges = _.debounce(batchLog, 1000);\n * Object.observe(models.todo, todoChanges);\n *\n * Object.observe(models, function(changes) {\n *   if (_.find(changes, { 'user': 'todo', 'type': 'delete'})) {\n *     todoChanges.cancel();\n *   }\n * }, ['delete']);\n *\n * // ...at some point `models.todo` is changed\n * models.todo.completed = true;\n *\n * // ...before 1 second has passed `models.todo` is deleted\n * // which cancels the debounced `todoChanges` call\n * delete models.todo;\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var args,\n      maxTimeoutId,\n      result,\n      stamp,\n      thisArg,\n      timeoutId,\n      trailingCall,\n      lastCalled = 0,\n      maxWait = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = wait < 0 ?
